# Getting Started

## Install

GraphQL Explorer allows to visually navigate a graphql schema and fire mutations from autogenerated forms. The initial set-up is easy and requires few steps.

```bash
  yarn add graphql-explorer
```

You will need to import the required CSS files. Depending on whether you are already importing Bootstrap or not in your application, you can import two different stylesheets

```ts
// if your app has not imported bootstrap already
import 'graphql-explorer/styles/style.css';
// if you are already importing bootstrap somewhere else
import 'graphql-explorer/styles/style-no-bootstrap.css';
```

:::note
Graphql Explorer uses [bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/getting-started/introduction/). using another version of bootstrap or another CSS library might interfere with the correct rendering of the components
:::

## Configure

Let's look at how to configure the basic options for GraphQL Explorer. In order to create a configuration, you need to have two objects:

- a [GraphQLSchema](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/blob/2df59f18dd3f3c415eaba57d744131a674079ddf/src/type/schema.ts#L129) object
- an [ApolloClient](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/blob/2535eccfdc15c459a8772b50d2a53dd997f7c3fb/src/core/ApolloClient.ts#L90) object

You can consult the respective recommendation on how to create such objects. Then you can import and initialize the `ExplorerConfiguration` Class:

```tsx
import { ExplorerConfiguration } from 'graphql-explorer';

let schema: GraphQLSchema;
let client: ApolloClient;

const configuration = new ExplorerConfiguration(schema, client);
```

## Integrate

Now the only thing left is to build and mount the main `Explorer` component:

```tsx
import { Explorer } from 'graphql-explorer';

function MyApp({ configuration }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <Explorer config={configuration} />
    </div>
  )
}
```

that's it! Explore the rest the documentation to learn how to customize the various components of GraphQL Explorer.
